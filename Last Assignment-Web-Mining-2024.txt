Questions:
1. (3 marks) Association Rule Mining in Web Data:
Consider a web application that tracks user interactions (clicks, searches, page visits) in an e-commerce
website. Discuss how association rule mining could be used to discover patterns in the browsing
behavior of users. Provide an example of a rule that could be generated from such data (e.g., "If a
user clicks on product A, they are likely to click on product B"). Include the
terms support, confidence, and lift in your explanation.
2. (3 marks) Sequential Pattern Mining:
Sequential pattern mining is often used to discover patterns in web data over time (e.g., sequences of
pages visited by a user). Suppose you have the following sequence of user actions on a website:
•
•
•

User 1: [Home → Product Page → Checkout]
User 2: [Home → Search → Product Page → Checkout]
User 3: [Home → Product Page → Checkout]

Explain how sequential pattern mining can be applied to identify frequent sequences. What is the
minimum support threshold that would generate the sequence "Home → Product Page → Checkout"?
3. (4 marks) Clustering Patterns in Web Data:
A website collects information on the types of articles read by users, including categories such as
"Sports", "Technology", and "Entertainment". Users are grouped based on their browsing patterns.
Describe how clustering can be applied to this web data to group users with similar interests. Mention
at least one clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN) that could be useful for this task and explain
how it works in brief.
4. (5 marks) Evaluation of Pattern Mining Techniques:
Evaluate the effectiveness of pattern mining techniques in web mining. Discuss one advantage and
one limitation of using pattern mining for web data.

Final Project Submission Guidelines and
Requirements
Overview:

For the final project in the Web Mining course, students are required
to select and implement one algorithm from the list below. The project
aims to deepen your understanding of data mining techniques, their
practical applications, and analytical insights.

Algorithm Options:

1. Apriori
2. FP-Growth
3. DBSCAN
4. Bayes Classification
5. CAR
6. K-means
7. ID3

Project Examples:
Example 1: Text Categorization using Multinomial Naïve Bayesian
Method

Purpose:

Implement text topic categorization to understand the principles and
methods of the multinomial naïve Bayesian algorithm. Gain insights
into basic preprocessing steps in textual data mining.

Requirements:

a. Show micro-average and macro-average accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1-value using 10-fold cross-validation.
b. Use the dataset available at [THUCTC](http://thuctc.thunlp.org/).
c. Choose any programming language, such as C, C++, Java, or Python.
d. Prepare an experimental report including the following sections:

the

Apriori

Algorithm

and

testing

it

empirically.

Purpose:

Understand and implement the Apriori algorithm to test its performance
and behavior with transactional datasets.

Requirements:

a. Test implementation with any transactional dataset.

b. Show frequent itemsets and strong association rules for varying
Min_Sup and Min_Conf values.
c. Analyze time and memory usage under different Min_Sup and
Min_Conf configurations.
d. Choose any programming language, such as C, C++, Java, or Python.
e. Prepare an experimental report including the same sections
listed in Example 1.

Submission Guidelines:
a. Deliverables:
I.
A project report of at least 4000 words adhering to the
format provided.
II.
A screen-recorded video showing the real-time execution of
your project code.
b. Submission Deadline: 10th January 2025
c. Submission Method: Email both the report and the video to
3168744799@qq.com
d. Honesty Code:
I.
All submissions must be your original work.
II.
Any form of cheating or plagiarism will result in a *ZERO*
grade.

Grading Criteria:

- Algorithm understanding and analysis.
- Accuracy and clarity of results.
- Quality of the report and adherence to formatting requirements.
- Creativity and effort in implementation.

Good luck with your project!
